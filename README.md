# My Rent Account

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

The app needs Node 12, if you have [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed just run `nvm use` in your terminal.

Install the dependencies:

    yarn install

Run the development server:

    yarn dev

Update your hosts file and add this line to make the Google Single Sign On work:
127.0.0.1   dev.myrentaccount.hackney.gov.uk

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://dev.myrentaccount.hackney.gov.uk:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
